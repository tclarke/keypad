Simple SDL touchscreen PIN entry tool for raspberry pi.

Currently works with Raspberry pi zero w with red/green leds on GPIO 20/21.
You may need to adjust the gpio pin numbers in leds.c

Create a /etc/keypad/codes file with "name:pin" entries for all valid PINs. You should make this root 0400.
The tool must be run as root or with privleges for /dev/console, /etc/keypad/codes, and the /dev/mem.
